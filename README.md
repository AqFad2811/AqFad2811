# About Me
### My name is AqFad, and I'm currently using github for these projects :



- myiptv (https://github.com/AqFad2811/myiptv)
  -  A repository that I currently used for EPG's, formerly had a popular playlist here, but I moved it to keep it safe.
- BernamaHDYT (https://github.com/AqFad2811/BernamaHDYT)
   -  Forked repository from [@benmoose39](https://github.com/benmoose39), using Bernama TV live stream and put it on my playlist.
- fatwatvyt (https://github.com/AqFad2811/fatwatvyt)
   - same as BernamaHDYT repo, but it's Fatwa TV.
- randomlivefromyt (https://github.com/AqFad2811/randomlivefromyt)
   - A random livestream from YouTube, sometimes I use it for my playlist and sometimes for anything else.
